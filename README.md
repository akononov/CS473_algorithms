# CS 473 exercises

In this repository, I'm collecting a series of exercises that I'm completing as I work through [link] Algorithms course materials. Below is a list of all the exercises I've done along with short descriptions of each excercise.

  
### Dynamic Programming

* 01_longest_increasing_subsequence.py&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    find longest increasing subsequence of an input sequence

* 02_shortest_common_superstring.py&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       find shortest common superstring of two strings

<!--03_optimal_binary_search_tree.py        find most efficient binary search tree given search frequencies-->

<!--04_max_independent_set_tree.py          find largest subset of nodes of a tree where no two nodes are adjacent-->

  
### Randomized Algorithms
